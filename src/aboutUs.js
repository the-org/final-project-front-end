        <h3>I was worked as a HVAC technician in U.S. Army for four and half years. From this job I learned lots of experience. It teaches me to pay attention on details and follow the rules. I thinks these attributes also work in developing world. Without paying attention on details, you may miss a colon or curly bracket which results whole codes donâ€™t work. Without following the programming language rules, the machine could not understand what we write. I decide to learn software development because I want to pick up what I learn from my school and use them as a tool to help people to have a easier life. </h3>
